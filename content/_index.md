The Mainland Big Band is a very experienced dance band with a long history of music-making in Canterbury. With more than 409 years’ experience, the Band is well-equipped to help you plan a programme to suit your particular needs. 

The dedicated team of up to 19 musicians rehearses weekly under the direction of a talented Musical Director, expanding its already comprehensive repertoire, and maintaining its performance standard at a high level. 

The Band has performed regularly in many of the Working Men’s Clubs of Christchurch as well as for private weddings, receptions, and large formal, corporate dinner-dances for many years.
