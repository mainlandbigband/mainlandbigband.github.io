The Mainland Big Band is a very experienced dance band with a long history of music-making in Christchurch and the Canterbury region. We perform regularly across the region, as well as for private weddings, receptions and large formal, corporate dinner-dances.

We are a dedicated team of up to 17 musicians who rehearse weekly under the direction of a talented Musical Director. We have a constantly-expanding repertoire, and with more than 50 yearsâ€™ experience, we are well-equipped to help you plan a programme to suit your particular needs. 

If you would like to hire us for your event, please do get in touch with us using the details on our [contact](/contact) page</a>. We would be happy to tailor an event to your specific requirements!
