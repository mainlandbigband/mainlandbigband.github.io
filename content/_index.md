The Mainland Big Band is a very experienced dance band with a long history of music-making in Christchurch and the Canterbury region. We perform regularly across the region, as well as for private weddings, receptions and large formal, corporate dinner-dances.

We are a dedicated team of up to 17 musicians who rehearse weekly under the direction of a talented Musical Director. We have a constantly-expanding repertoire, and with more than 50 yearsâ€™ experience, we are well-equipped to help you plan a programme to suit your particular needs.
