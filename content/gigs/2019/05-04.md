We are delighted to have Michael, aka 'Ritchie Venus' (lead guitar and vocals) doing a feature performance.

Michael is a regular performer in his own right around Christchurch and his career includes film, published film reviews and original recordings. He will perform his recent American hit record, along with some popular standards. We all look forward to hearing what he will do.
