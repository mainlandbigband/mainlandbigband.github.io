**The Big Band Festival Picnic**

Come one, come all, for a picnic in the Botanic Gardens with a Big Band twist!

Relax on the Archery Lawn for a day of live music; we'll be closing off this year's annual Christchurch Big Band Festival with a bang.

[We're on at 1.30pm](https://www.chchbigbandfest.com/plan-your-festival/big-band-picnic)!
