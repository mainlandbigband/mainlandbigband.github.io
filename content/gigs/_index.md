We perform regular dance evenings across Canterbury. Each dance lasts around three hours and normally costs only $10 -- great value for such a lot of entertainment!

Under the traffic light system, we are able to perform under levels GREEN and ORANGE. Gigs will not go ahead under the RED level.

Most venues we perform at are currently required vaccine passes for entry.

Why not pop along to our next gig?
