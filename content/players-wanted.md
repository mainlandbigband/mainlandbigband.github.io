The Mainland Big Band is a long-established, 19-piece, Christchurch dance band with a large and very varied repertoire ranging from Big Band and jazz standards to rock and pop. The Band rehearses weekly on Wednesday evenings and performs publicly at least once per month. Note that our positions are _voluntary_ -- for the majority of members the Band is a sideline and not a career.

We require our players to be a good team members, be prepared to attend regular rehearsals and be available for performances (allowances are, of course, always made for sickness, holidays, family birthdays, anniversaries etc!)

##### If you would like more information about the vacancies below please phone Colin on 027 441 1490 or email <info@mainlandbigband.co.nz>
